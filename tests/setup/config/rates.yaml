# Rate configuration for test setup.
#
# Sets actual rates on SKUs that were created with $0.01 placeholders
# during migration 0022 and sync_node_skus.
#
# defaults.is_public controls SKU visibility on the Current Rates page.
# Per-entry is_public overrides the default (e.g. configured SKUs are
# made public while unconfigured SKUs remain hidden).
#
# defaults.effective_date can be any date including past dates, or the
# special value "today" which resolves to the current date at runtime.
# Using "today" ensures the new rate always takes precedence over any
# placeholder rate created by migrations or sync_node_skus.
#
# This file is consumed by modules/05_rates.sh, which calls
#   coldfront set_sku_rate <sku_code> <rate> [options]
# for every entry below.
#
# Depends on:
#   - users_multi.yaml  (creates orcd_rtm, the rate manager)
