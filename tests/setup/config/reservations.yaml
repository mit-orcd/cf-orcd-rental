# Reservation configuration for multi-user test setup.
#
# This config drives a two-stage workflow:
#   Stage 1 (07_1_create_reservations.sh):
#     Creates reservations as PENDING, submitted by the user specified
#     in `requesting_user` (project owner or technical admin).
#   Stage 2 (07_2_confirm_reservations.sh):
#     Approves all reservations as the rental manager specified in
#     the `approval` section.
#
# Each entry specifies:
#   - node_address:     GPU node instance to reserve (must be rentable)
#   - project:          Project to bill the reservation to
#   - requesting_user:  User submitting the request (must be owner,
#                       technical_admin, or member of the project)
#   - start_date:       Reservation start date, relative to today
#                       (resolved at runtime by resolve_relative_date)
#   - num_blocks:       Duration in 12-hour blocks (1 block = 12 hours)
#   - rental_notes:     Optional notes from the requester
#
# START DATE FORMAT:
#   Dates use the "today+N" format, where N is the number of days from
#   today.  The resolve_relative_date function (in lib/common.sh)
#   converts these to YYYY-MM-DD at runtime, so the config works
#   regardless of when the scripts are run.
#
#   Supported formats: "today+7", "today + 7", "today + 7 days",
#   "today" (today itself), or "YYYY-MM-DD" (absolute passthrough).
#
# IMPORTANT: No two reservations on the same node_address may overlap.
# Reservations start at 4:00 PM on start_date and last num_blocks * 12
# hours.  When scheduling multiple reservations on the same node, space
# them far enough apart so the earlier one ends before the next begins.
#
# Timing reference (all start at 4:00 PM):
#   1 block  =  12h -> ends  4:00 AM next day   (occupies ~0.5 day)
#   2 blocks =  24h -> ends  4:00 PM next day   (occupies ~1 day)
#   3 blocks =  36h -> ends  4:00 AM day+2      (occupies ~1.5 days)
#   4 blocks =  48h -> ends  4:00 PM day+2      (occupies ~2 days)
#   5 blocks =  60h -> ends  4:00 AM day+3      (occupies ~2.5 days)
#   7 blocks =  84h -> ends  4:00 AM day+4      (occupies ~3.5 days)
#  14 blocks = 168h -> ends  4:00 PM day+7      (occupies ~7 days)

# Eligible requesting users per project (from members.yaml):

# Depends on:

#   - projects.yaml          (creates the projects referenced here)
#   - members.yaml           (assigns technical admin roles)
#   - cost_allocations.yaml  (projects must have APPROVED cost allocations)
